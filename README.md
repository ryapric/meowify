meowify
=======

This is the stupidest thing I've ever made.

Given a single command-line arg as a sentence, generates a string of `:meow_{t}:` emojis,
where `t` is a letter in the sentence.

You can run it ad-hoc locally, or (for example) register it as a slash-command in Slack by
hooking it up to a Lambda in AWS. I dunno, go wild.

Jesus, why
----------

So you can copy & paste tons of emojis into Slack or whatever, assuming you have the corresponding
emojis available in your workspace. Annoy your friends & neighbors. Make messages harder to read,
but oh so kawaii.

"I don't even know what this is for, wtf is a 'meow emoji'?"

Idk man, it works in my work's Slack account.
